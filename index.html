There are an estimated 10^22-10^24 stars in the observable universe, an area about 93 billion light years in diameter. Unfortunately, most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, and all individual stars outside the Milky Way are not visible even to technology.</h3></td>

It will then increase in density until it collapses under its own gravitational force and begins to enter the main sequence of a star's evolution, where it will spend the majority of the rest of its life fusing hydrogen into helium. After the main sequence, stars will end their lives as different things depending on the amount of mass they contain. <a href="evolution.html">Learn about the evolutionary sequence of stars in detail.</a></h3></td>

This is because we know how the luminosity of stars increases with age for different types of stars. Another method is by measure of rate of rotation. This works because the rate of rotation of stars declines steadily with age. <a href="study.html">Click here to learn more about how scientists have determined the age, chemical composition, distance, and size of stars.</a></h3></td>
