                <h3>One method for measuring the age of stars is by determining luminosity. Because the luminosity of stars increases with age, the age of stars can be determined given luminosity and knowledge of the type of star. However, this method does not apply to all types of stars, because the standard relationship for determination of age doesn’t apply to stars in advanced evolutionary stages, such as the red giant phase. As such, only the minimum age of stars like red giants can be determined through calculation of the star’s main-sequence lifetime. But this method is still very accurate, as stars spend only about 1% of their lives as a red giant.</h3>
                <h3>Another method is checking for inclusion in star clusters and systems. Rough ages can be assigned to all stars in a cluster or system through determination of the age of specific stars through other methods.</h3>
                <h3>Another method is gyrochronology. Gyrochronology is a method that determines the age of stars by making calculations based on a star’s rate of rotation. This works because the rate of rotation in stars declines steadily with their age.</h3>

                <h3>Stars in the Milky Way galaxy are made of approximately 71% hydrogen, 27% helium, and a little amount of heavier elements. Spectroscopy has helped us to understand this.</h3>
                <h3>
                White light consists of every hue in the rainbow. When it is split with a prism, these colours can be observed. When this was first done with the Sun’s light in 1802, scientists discovered that there appeared to be dark lines in the colour spectrum.</h3>
                <h3>
                People realised that the dark lines showed colours that were missing from the spectrum. They were missing because elements in and around the Sun were absorbing these specific wavelengths of light. The dark lines therefore indicated the presence of certain elements such as hydrogen, sodium and calcium.</h3>
                <h3>
                This method of checking the wavelengths of light to determine chemical composition is known as spectroscopy, and it remains the most popular method by which to determine the chemical properties of celestial objects.

                <h3>To capture pictures of most stars, interferometer telescopes are needed since most stars appear to be too small to see using ground-based optical telescopes.</h3>
                <h3>
                Astronomical interferometers provide better resolution photographs of celestial objects like stars, nebulas, and galaxies by combining a number of different telescopes, mirror segments, or radio telescope antennas. Using these images, the diameter of stars can be measured.</h3>
                <h3>
                Another method is occultation. The diameter of a star can be calculated by carefully observing the decrease in brightness of a star when it is obscured by the Moon (or the increase in brightness when it emerges).

                <h2 class = "col">How Far?</h2>
                <h3>The distance of a star can be calculated given the measurement of its parallax. Parallax is the apparent change in position of an object due to a change in the point of view of the observer; an example of this would be the shift in the position of your thumb when you view it with your left eye compared to when you view it with your right eye.</h3>
                <h3>
                If the distance between the two viewpoints is known, then the distance to the object can be determined. This works because the amount of shift in the object changes depending on how far away the object is; the object will shift a lot if it is nearby, and it will shift less if it is farther away. This method works quite well, but there is a limit to how far away we can reliably perceive distance with just our eyes.</h3>
                <h3>
                But this limit can be increased if the distance between the two viewpoints is increased. 
                If we observe a star 6 months apart when the Earth is on opposite sides of its orbit around the Sun, then we can measure the distance to relatively nearby stars, stars that are within about 1000 light years.</h3>
                <h3>
                Once we know the distance to nearby stars, we can determine the distance of stars that are farther away by comparing the brightness of nearby stars to father stars of the same type. This works because light falls off with the square of the distance; so a more distant star will appear fainter in luminosity than the less distant of two identical stars. We can measure this difference in luminosity and use it to determine the distance to the further star.</h3>
                <h3>
                So if we can figure out how far away a star is by measuring its parallax, we can figure out how far away more distant stars are by comparing the brightness of the two, given that they are the same type of star.

                <h3>Stellar kinematics is the study of how stars move through space. The movement of a celestial object away from or towards the solar system is referred to as its radial velocity. By measuring the object's doppler shift, one may ascertain this. An object's doppler shift is the variation in frequency of the waves it emits as a result of its motion with respect to the observer. The frequency of the waves will rise as the wave-emitting item gets closer to the observer because each new wave is generated at a location that is somewhat closer to the observer. In contrast, if the item was moving away from the viewer, the frequency of waves would be decreasing. The amount that an object travels towards or away from the observer may be estimated by measuring this shift.</h3>
                <h3>
                The motion of a star in relation to other celestial bodies is referred to as the proper motion of a celestial object. Measurements of parallax (the apparent change in location of an object owing to a change in the observer's point of view) and distance are used to establish the proper motion of a star. The proper motion velocity may be estimated using the star's distance and parallax. Due to their likelihood of being very near to the Sun, stars with fast proper motion become excellent candidates for precise measurement of other objects.
